The most recent version of these codes are collected in the file CodesMODE.zip that is available as support material at

No claim of accuracy is made and no responsibility is taken for possible errors.  
These files are distributed freely as didactical support to the content of the 
book mentioned above. 
These codes have been written by me, my students, other Colleagues, including those taken from other 
sources and eventually modified.

The organisation of the codes follows the structure of the book.
